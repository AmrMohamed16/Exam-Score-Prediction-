# Brief
As education becomes increasingly data-driven, predicting student performance offers valuable guidance for teachers, parents, and institutions.
This project develops a Linear Regression model that forecasts exam scores using academic, personal, and socio-economic factors.

# DataSet
The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lainguyn123/student-performance-factors) consists of 5,836 student records, capturing a variety of academic, personal, and socio-economic
factors that may influence exam performance. 
It includes details such as study habits, attendance, family background, school environment, and lifestyle aspects. The target variable is Exam_Score, representing each student’s
final performance.
